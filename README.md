# Immersive Language Learning System

The Immersive Language Learning System is a language learning method designed to provide an immersive language learning experience for users. The system uses scannable physical visual aids, such as stickers or note cards, which display different words in the language to be learned. These visual aids are attached to real-world objects in the user's environment.

## Features

- Scannable Visual Aids: The system includes a set of visual aids that can be scanned using a mobile device equipped with an imaging device, such as a smartphone camera. These visual aids display words in the target language and are attached to corresponding real-world objects.

- Software Application: The system includes a software application that runs on the mobile device. This application is configured to read the coded information on each visual aid through the device's camera and provide the user with information to facilitate learning of the word displayed on the visual aid.

- Prompt and Scan Game: The software application includes a game mode called "Prompt and Scan." In this game, the user is provided with an audible pronunciation of a word on a visual aid and prompted to scan the visual aid that displays the spoken word. This game mode helps reinforce word recognition and pronunciation.

- Geolocation Game: The software application also includes a game mode called "Geolocation." In this game, the user is presented with visual aids attached to different real-world objects in the user's environment. If the user correctly scans a visual aid in response to being presented with a given word, the application records the coordinates of the visual aid and the object it is attached to. Subsequent plays of the game will guide the user to the correct object using geolocation cues.

- Audio Feedback and Pronunciation Improvement: The software application allows the user to provide audio input in the form of spoken words. The application uses this audio input to evaluate and improve the user's pronunciation of the spoken word.

- Additional Application Functions: The software application includes various additional functions, such as providing information on word usage in phrases or sentences, presenting visual representations of words, directing the user to websites or webpages for additional information, and offering a choice between immersion mode and game mode.

## Step 1: Setting up Visual Aids 

Each set of scannable physical visual aids include stickers or note cards that can be attached to real-world objects in your environment. For instance, a sticker or card labeled with the target language word for "table" could be attached to your dining table. 

## Step 2: Launching the Application 

The software application built into the system can be installed and launched on your mobile device. This application is compatible with popular mobile operating systems.

## Step 3: Scanning the Visual Aids 

By using the camera of your mobile device, you can scan the visual aids. The application is designed to read the coded information on each visual aid and provide learning cues (such as the word's meaning, its synonyms, usage in phrases or sentences, or links to further informative resources).

## Step 4: Exploring Application Modes 

The application comes with two main game modes: 
- **Prompt and Scan** provides an audible pronunciation of a word on a visual aid and requires you to scan the visual aid that matches the spoken word. This can greatly help reinforce word recognition and pronunciation.
- **Geolocation** is a game in which the app stores the coordinates of objects attached with visual aids that you scan correctly; On subsequent plays, it prompts you to find the same objects again using geolocation cues.

## Step 5: Utilizing Feedback & Pronunciation Features 

The application offers audio feedback and pronunciation improvement features. It allows you to provide audio input by speaking words, which it then uses to evaluate and consequently improve your pronunciation of said words. 

## Step 6: Customizing your Learning Experience 

Within the application, you can choose to use various visual aids, themes, and game modes, depending on your personal preference and needs. 

## Step 7: Tracking Progress 

A built-in feature of the application is the ability to keep track of progress via game scores and statistics. 

## Step 8: Updating and Accessing Additional Resources 

From time to time, updates to the application will be released. These updates may offer additional features, learning materials or resources that can enhance your language learning experience. Be sure to regularly update the application to benefit from these enhancements.
